# SystemZ

> *SystemZ is the structured externalization of my personal operating system — designed to shape the foundations, capabilities, and conditions required for long-term success.*

This repository is a log and interface to my evolving system of thought and execution. I use it to document:

- Daily achievements  
- Weekly feedback and experiments in system design of the self

I see myself not only as a person but as a recursive system — capable of observing, debugging, and upgrading itself. This repository is a concrete instantiation of that process.
